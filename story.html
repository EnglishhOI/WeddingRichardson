                    The First time I had met Carla was online when she joined The Nuts Shack (Online community on Discord). Before I introduced myself to Carla she pointed me out and told me that she had seen a picture of me and that Al (mutual friend) had spoken highly of me. I wanted to see a picture of Carla so I jokingly told her that she needs to send a picture of what she looks like because it was unfair that she's seen what I look like but I hadn't seen her. I got a personal message from Carla 5 minutes later saying "hello" followed by a picture of herself. I told her she looked cute and proceeded to talk to her in private to get to know her better. I told people in the community that they should join the voice channel to "Chill and talk" even though it was just a cover so I can talk to Carla over voice. After a while of talking I needed to go to sleep so I said goodnight to Carla and that I would message her in the morning. as the week went on I had found myself growing more and more interested In Carla and started to develop feelings for her. I decided that I wanted more from our relationship than just friends, I wanted to be together. I first asked her if she just wanted to be friends and she would just give me the answer "I want to be more". I wanted to hear specifically what she wanted so I kept on repeating the question over and over again which she eventually cracked and said that she wanted to be boyfriend and girlfriend which I replied: "It's settled then, from today we're together".

                <p>
                    Months went by and my love for Carla had developed into something I couldn't imagine. by this point, Carla had changed her sleep clock to match mine to maximize the time we could spend with each other, and we decided to sleep with our laptops on so it simulated sleeping next to each other. At this point, I really wanted to see Carla in person and I told Carla that this is what I wanted, we immediately started planning the trip.  We decided that I was going to come over for 2 weeks because that's all I could get off of work, we were going to spend most of our time in Manila, then go to San Pablo where Carla lives so I can visit and spend time with her family, and then finally returning to Manila where we would spend the remainder of the trip before departing back to England. Around this time I knew I wanted to spend my future with Carla and I wanted to invest into our relationship, I did some research and decided I liked a place called sanerra sub division. the houses were well built and it looked very spacious and also added a lot of security measures. I proceeded to tell carla of my plans and asked her to visit the houses to see what she thought of them and to also take pictures so I could see. That night I decided that I wanted the house and asked carla to go back to sanerra the very next day to put down a reservation fee.

                <p>
                    It was time to fly. after over 16 hours of flying I finaly landed in Manila. Once I landed I got nervous and excited about meeting Carla. We couldn't find each other for about 20 minutes because Carla thought I came out at a different area. Once wondering around for a while I finally found Carla and a rush of nerves went through me because I didn't know if Carla would kiss me back so I decided the give her a hug which she wanted a kiss which was very awkward and embarrassing. the first few days were spent just hanging out in the condo because I was jetlagged and we just wanted to chill for a few days. After those days passed we did a lot of activities such as Escape Rooms, shopping at SM North Edsa, Bowling, Karaoke, and Billiards. I was having the best time of my life in just a little amount of time I was there. we were also joined on the trip by 2 of our friends: Al, the mutual friend that sent Carla pictures of me, and Helal, Another online friend that came from kuwait. we Did a lot in such a short time and it was very exhausting but, It was worth every minute. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Halfway through the trip I didn't go to sleep the same time as Carla and I just sat at the end of the bed thinking about how the last 6 months couldn't have been any better and how happy I was in our relationship. I didn't want this moment to end and I remember looking at Carla whilst she slept and thought about how I wanted to share my future with her, and that she was the one for me. the more I thought the more I realize that I wanted to marry her. That same night I started planning how I was going to do it and more importantly how was I going to get an engagement ring as we never left each other's side then I remembered a little ring called the Promise ring. Once it was the morning I decided to Carla a little lie by telling her I wanted to buy her a promise ring, This way I could search for a ring and not have any suspicions. on the 4th September, I still hadn't found a ring I liked but luckily we were going to the Mall of Asia on that day. We went in and out of shops the entire day but the mall was too big and wasn't able to find anything yet. The mall was about to close so we decided to go to a previous shop that we had been in that had my favourite ring of the day in. I bought the ring with Carla still having no idea that that ring is an engagement ring. Now it was onto how I was going to deliver the ring to carla fast before she takes it as a promise ring. As soon as we left the Mall of Asia I was in luck because we came across a fair on Manila Bay and Carla really wanted to ride the Ferris wheel. I thought to myself that this may be a bit cliche of a proposal but, Proposing on Manila Bay, at night, on top of a Ferris wheel would be a special moment for the both of us and that is exactly what I did.

                <p>
                    Sadly, the next day came around and it was time for me to head back to England. I didn't want to go back as it meant the trip would come to an end and it had been the best 15 days of my entire life. I left my new fiancee and friends for a brief moment to check my bags in and to retrive my boarding passes before I hurried back to them. we sat outside security and the time came to say goodbye for now.  I arrived back in England on the 6th September and as soon asI  got out of baggage claim I immediately called Carla to let her know I landed safely and to make sure she was ok. a week later we started discussing our future plans and what our next steps would be. We both knew that we wanted to be back together as soon as possible but this time we wouldn't leave each others side. We made the decision that Carla was going to come to england on a marriage visit visa and get married in England, This would also allow me to save up as much money as possible for furniture for the house,  put a deposit down on a van in philippines to start a van rental business,and this would also allow me to save for a second wedding that will take place in the philippines for Carlas family. Once we are married we will go to the embassy of the philippines in london where we would register our marriage. Once that is completed we will start the proccess for me to get a visa for the philippines where afterwards we will fly back to to start our life together.

                    My good friend Al, whom I always talked about life sent me pictures of different people. He said that he liked me to meet them, and told me to install discord and join the online community he was in. I’m not a very talkative person even if it’s just a chat. I just said “hi” and replied to anyone that welcomed me to the server. There was this one guy who caught my attention, his username was “Englishh”. He was friendly towards everyone and he also welcomed me to the server. Al sent me a private message and told me that he is one of the people in the pictures that he sent to me. Then I just typed in the chat saying that “Englishh is good looking”. After that he said that I should send a photo in return so he can return the compliment. I don’t like to send my pictures but Al encouraged me to do so. I sent it to Englishh and said “hello”, he replied with “damn, you’re cute”. After that, we got to know each other and found out that his real name is Rhys Richardson and he’s from England. We then talked on a voice call within the other server members. We talked a lot everyday and we also send a lot of pictures to each other. The first two days of knowing him are just normal conversations. As the days passed the level of our conversations got deeper and the more we got to know each other. I told him my life story and I felt myself starting to feel comfortable talking to him, after a few weeks I fell in love with him.

                <p>
                    18th February, when we are in a voice call we started to talk about us. He asked me if I only wanted to be friends with him, and I replied that “I want to be more” and he jokingly said “best friends?”, and I keep on asking me again and again until I replied with “boyfriend and girlfriend”. After that he just said “It’s settled then, from this day we’re together”. I though he was still joking at first so I kept asking if he was serious about it until he took a picture of him self holding up a sign saying “I am being serious”. After that we became boyfriend and girlfriend, and I changed my body clock to match his. I did that because I’m really happy to see and talk to him, and I know being in a long-distance relationship is really hard and you need to make sacrifices so that the relationship will be strong. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re always on call and while we were sleeping I secretly took a screenshot of our video call so I can make a photo album about us. Rhys told me that he wants to see me in person and so did I. we planned his trip to come here in the Philippines and finally we booked his flights in June for his tip that will last for 2 weeks starting on the 22nd of August until the 5th September. After a week, we booked out accommodations and planned out activities for those 2 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    21st August came, It’s time for Rhys to fly from Manchester to Manila. Rhys Arrived on the 22nd of August, I picked him up at the airport together with my sister and her boyfriend. I didn’t sleep the night before because of nerves, excitement, and happiness. When I saw him I can’t explain the feeling “he’s actually here”, I ran up to him and gave him a really big hug, after that we went to a Chinese restaurant to each lunch and then go to the accommodation we booked earlier in Quezon City. Once we got to the accommodation we took some pictures together and passed out as we were both exhausted, the next day our friend names Helal flew into Manila from Kuwait and Al picked him up. After a good rest my mom visited us and we went to Manila to explore different areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3 days later all 4 of us went to play pool. I don’t know how to play pool so Rhys taught me, and we had a 2 vs 2, Me and Rhys vs Al and Helal which luckily we beat them. Afterwards we decided we wanted to sing so we went to a Karaoke bar where we ate, got drunk, and sang a lot. The very next day Rhys wanted to explore SM North EDSA so we went and Rhys bought a lot of gifts including perfume, Converse, Nike shoes, Sandals, and a handbag. We chose to go to Vikings buffet to eat and Rhys invited my sister and her friend to join us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    29th August and Rhys and I planned to see more of the Philippines so my Mom and Dad picked us up and we drove to San Pablo City where we went to pandin lake for a day out and ate food and went swimming in the lake.  The very next day after that we had a family day and went to the metro turf to watch horse racing that Rhys requested. Me and Rhys bet together and we was able to win a few races aswell as lose a few. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    4th September was the sweetest day of my life and the most unforgettable moment. This is the day that Rhys proposed to me. I didn’t expect that this would happen and thought the ring that he bought was just a promise ring. After he bought the ring and told me it was a promise ring and he will give it to me later I told him that I wanted to go on the Ferris wheel. We got to the ferris wheel and paid for our tickets, once we got to the top of the wheel he said “I want to kneel but I can’t because the carriage is too small” I replied with “ok” because I didn’t know what he was saying. He then proceeded to tell me how much he loves me and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and asked the question “Will you marry me?”. I was shocked and couldn’t explain the feeling, and I said “of course I will”. After putting the ring on my finger we proceeded to ride more rides on manila bay and then went home. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The saddest day came, It’s time for Rhys to go home by before his flight we went swimming with Al and Helal in the hotels pool. After that we all spend the remainder of the time talking in our room. When we were at the airport and its time for him to go we both cried a lot and I hugged him very tight. I don’t want to let him go but he needs to go home. Before he left he promised me that that will be the last time that we will say goodbye to each other because the next time that we meet will be the time we start spending the rest of out lives together. When he arrived back in the UK he called me straight away and I told him that I miss him so much, When I saw him in my phone screen I started to cry again and told him that I wanted to hug and kiss him. Those 2 weeks that were together were the best 2 weeks of my life so far.
